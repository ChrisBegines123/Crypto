# Crypto Component

A simple Java component demonstrating key storage, encryption, decryption, and hashing following the OSU components discipline. This project includes interfaces, an abstract class, a kernel implementation, documentation, and a full JUnit test suite.

## Features
- Set, clear, generate, and retrieve symmetric keys
- Caesar-style encryption/decryption based on key hash
- Simple hash function: reverse + hex length
- Standard OSU component operations
- Two example use cases + full test suite
